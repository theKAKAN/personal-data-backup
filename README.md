Scripts that I plan to make/use to make a backup of my online data

## Dogsheep
While surfing the internet, I came across this wonderful repository called [Dogsheep](https://dogsheep.github.io/).  
Basically, it lets you backup *some* online accounts to a SQLite database and then view/analyse them using other programs, preferrably [Datasette](https://datasette.io/) as the database was made with that in mind.

## What I'm backing up
* [Google Takeout](https://github.com/dogsheep/google-takeout-to-sqlite)
* [Github](https://github.com/dogsheep/github-to-sqlite)
* [Pocket](https://github.com/dogsheep/pocket-to-sqlite)
* [Twitter](https://github.com/dogsheep/twitter-to-sqlite)
